      <h1>Our Surrogacy Story</h1>
      <p>
        Baby Dax's countdown started long before the third trimester. This is the map of how a Colorado dream, a team
        of brilliant guides, and a whole lot of heart brought us right to this moment.

            <h3>Finding Home Base</h3>
            <p>
              We purchased our mountain home in Colorado and carved out space for future bedtime stories, snow-day
              adventures, and visits from the people who would one day help us build a family.

            <h3>Choosing Our Guides</h3>
            <p>
              Circle Surrogacy became our North Star. Their team patiently explained every milestone so we could enter
              the process with steady expectations and big hope.

            <h3>Signing On</h3>
            <p>
              Paperwork gave way to purpose as we officially signed with Circle, met coordinators, and started building
              the medical, legal, and emotional scaffolding that would hold us up over the coming years.

            <h3>Connecting with Brit</h3>
            <p>
              We were matched with Brit, our generous egg donor, and quickly moved from formal introductions to real
              friendship. Group texts, photo swaps, and shared playlists turned coordination calls into genuine care.

            <h3>Science &amp; Safeguards</h3>
            <p>
              With Brit's help we created embryos, then leaned on Herasight's genetic screening to double-check that the
              tiny building blocks for Baby Dax were healthy and ready for the next leap.

            <p>
              Transfer, early ultrasounds, and weekly updates later, we're deep in gratitude for our gestational carrier,
              the professionals at Circle, and the family + friends cheering from orbit as we await Dax's arrival.

        <h2>The People Behind the Magic</h2>
        <p>
          Surrogacy is more than timelines and test results. It's Brit sharing her heart, a gestational carrier tracking
          every nutrition note, coordinators who answer late-night questions, and grandparents who never miss a check-in
          call. Every person adds a strand to the web that keeps Dax safe.
        </p>
        <p>
          We keep a "mission log" filled with thank-yous—meals dropped at the door, surprise care packages, uplifting
          texts before each appointment, and the countless reminders that Dax already has a village.

        <h2>Lessons We'll Share with Dax</h2>
        <ul class="story-list">
          <li><strong>Home is intentional.</strong> We built it before we even knew him, because love is a decision.</li>
          <li><strong>Science is sacred.</strong> Circle Surrogacy, Herasight, and our doctors showed us that data and heart can work together.</li>
          <li><strong>Community matters.</strong> Brit, our carrier, and every helper proved that family is bigger than DNA.</li>
          <li><strong>Patience pays off.</strong> Years of paperwork, needles, and travel logs make his giggles even sweeter.</li>
        </ul>
