          <p>
            In the Star Trek universe, the <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Dax_(symbiont)" target="_blank">Dax</a> <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Trill_symbiont" target="_blank">symbiont</a> carries centuries of accumulated wisdom--lifetimes of experience woven together in a single being. Joined with <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Jadzia_Dax" target="_blank">Jadzia</a>, that legacy becomes something even more remarkable: a person who is sharp-minded, warm-hearted, unafraid of challenge, and unashamed of joy.
          </p>
          <p>
            We chose the name Dax because it captures qualities we hope our own Dax grows into: strength without rigidity, kindness without naïveté, intellect without pretense, and a spirit that is both playful and deeply principled. Jadzia's character embodies that rare combination of depth and lightness, seriousness and humor, confidence and awareness. That integration is what we want for our son.
          </p>
          <p>
            Below are some of the traits we admire most in Jadzia Dax, qualities we hope will shape Dax's own journey through life.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="section">
          <ul class="name-facts">
            <li><strong>Curiosity and Wonder</strong>: Jadzia is a scientist at heart, driven not by prestige, but by an authentic hunger to understand the universe. Whether she's unraveling a physics problem, mastering Klingon culture, or picking apart an ancient puzzle, she approaches knowledge with humility and delight. For our Dax, we hope he grows up believing that the world is endlessly fascinating and that learning is a lifelong adventure, not a school assignment.</li>
            <li><strong>Courage with Heart</strong>: Fearless but never reckless, Jadzia has a steady kind of bravery, rooted in principle, loyalty, and a willingness to stand up for what matters. She doesn't posture; she acts. For our Dax, may he be strong in the ways that count: willing to defend the truth, stand up for himself, and protect others, while facing challenges with grit and clarity.</li>
            <li><strong>Warmth, Kindness, and Loyalty</strong>: Beneath her formidable intelligence and warrior's training, Jadzia is disarmingly warm. Her friendships form the moral center of Deep Space Nine. She listens deeply, encourages freely, and brings out the best in the people she loves. For our Dax, we hope he becomes someone whose presence makes others feel seen, safe, and valued, someone who nurtures connection, rather than merely collecting relationships.</li>
            <li><strong>Humor and Confidence</strong>: Jadzia can trade quips with the best of them, always with just enough sass to lighten heavy moments. Her confidence is genuine, but never domineering. She knows who she is and doesn't need to prove it. For our Dax, we want him to have a grounded sense of self, the ease to laugh often, and the courage to be fully, unapologetically himself.</li>
            <li><strong>Strength of Body and Mind</strong>: Jadzia is both intellectually formidable and physically capable, a brilliant astrophysicist who's also a skilled athlete and fighter. Her competence is holistic, not compartmentalized. For our Dax, may he develop resilience--mental, emotional, and physical--so he can meet life's demands with balance and capability.</li>
            <li><strong>Wisdom Beyond One Lifetime</strong>: The Dax symbiont carries experience, but Jadzia brings perspective. She blends youthful enthusiasm with ancient insight, creating a character who is thoughtful without being jaded. For our Dax, we hope he grows into a person who can hold multiple truths at once, who approaches life with depth and openness.</li>
