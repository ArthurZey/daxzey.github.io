      <p>
        Showering Baby Dax with love will happen in phases, matching our family's warp-speed travel plans. Here's how we're
        lining up celebrations across the map.

        <h2>Why We're Waiting</h2>
        <p>
          We'd love nothing more than a pre-birth baby shower, but the logistics are straight out of a holodeck malfunction.
          Jessie needs to stay close to home, most friends and family are scattered across the country, and the
          calendar is packed with holiday travel. Rather than asking everyone to beam in during peak chaos without Jessie,
          we're pressing pause until gathering feels joyful and practical.

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Bergen Elementary School <s>Shower</s> Sprinkle</h2>
        <p>
          Chase's coworkers insisted on celebrating anyway, so they're hosting a cozy baby shower at his school on
          <strong>December 1, 2025</strong>. It's the perfect low-key sendoff before we pack the car, say goodbye to Colorado
          for a bit, and focus on the Kentucky chapter.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this phase, if people wish to help us prepare with baby essentials, we've prepared our <a href="/registry/" target="_blank">Amazon Baby Registry</a> for gifts that will be sent directly to our Kentucky address. Note that anything not purchased by the end of Amazon's Black Friday deals (December 1) will be purchased by us!
        </p>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Post-Birth Celebration in California</h2>
        <p>
          Once Dax arrives and we're settled with Arthur's parents in California, we'll host a non-traditional, post-birth
          baby shower near Los Angeles. It's closer to most of our people and an awesome excuse
          for everyone to meet the little star-in-training. Details will follow once we have a newborn-friendly schedule, but we're provisionally projecting mid- to late-April 2026.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this phase, if people wish to help us prepare our Montessori nursery/schoolhouse/paradise, we will share an updated registry with items more tailored to that stage of development. Stay tuned!
